# Overview

You are working in a project that uses VexFlow for music notation.

Before implementing, modifying, or debugging anything related to music notation:

1. Read the documentation under docs/music-notation/
2. Always read and follow vexflow-tutorial.md
3. Always read and follow vexflow-guidelines.md if present
4. Prefer project documentation over general VexFlow knowledge

Rules:

- Do not write VexFlow code before reviewing the documentation
- Follow the rendering flow defined in the docs
- Use SVG renderer unless explicitly instructed otherwise
- If something is unclear, infer from project examples before guessing

If you violate these rules, stop and re-evaluate the documentation.
