# Time Picker Redesign

## Overview

Redesigned the time selection interface with a sleek, professional modal window featuring scrollable wheel-style pickers for hours and minutes, similar to iOS-style time pickers.

## Components

### TimePickerModal.jsx

A new modal component that provides an elegant time selection interface with:

**Features:**

- **Scrollable Wheels**: Separate wheels for hours (0-23) and minutes (in 5-minute increments)
- **Visual Selection**: Highlighted selection area with semi-transparent overlay
- **Current Time Display**: Large, centered display showing the selected time
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Scroll-snap behavior for precise selection
- **Click to Select**: Direct click on any hour/minute to jump to it
- **Professional Design**:
  - Gradient dark theme with slate colors
  - Glass morphism effects with backdrop blur
  - Smooth animations and transitions
  - Custom thin scrollbars
- **Accessibility**:
  - Keyboard navigation support
  - Click-outside-to-close functionality
  - Clear visual feedback
  - ARIA-compliant buttons

**Props:**

- `isOpen`: Boolean to control modal visibility
- `onClose`: Callback when modal is closed
- `onConfirm`: Callback with selected time string (HH:MM format)
- `initialTime`: Initial time value (default: "09:00")

### TimePicker.jsx (Updated)

Enhanced the existing TimePicker component to:

- Replace native HTML time input with a styled button
- Display time in user-friendly 12-hour format with AM/PM
- Open the TimePickerModal on click
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing props
- Show clock icon with gradient background
- Disabled state support

## Design Features

### Visual Design

1. **Modal Background**:
   - Semi-transparent black backdrop with blur effect
   - Fade-in animation

2. **Modal Content**:
   - Gradient background (slate-900 to slate-800)
   - Rounded corners with subtle border
   - Shadow effects for depth
   - Professional header with icon and close button

3. **Time Wheels** (Optimized for Landscape):
   - 144px height (visible area showing ~4 items)
   - 36px item height (ITEM_HEIGHT constant - reduced for landscape)
   - 64px width per wheel (compact)
   - Padding top/bottom for scroll centering
   - Selected item: xl font, white, scaled 110%
   - Unselected items: base font, slate-500, normal scale
   - Hover effect on unselected items

4. **Selection Highlight**:
   - Blue semi-transparent background
   - Blue border top and bottom
   - 36px height matching item height
   - Positioned absolutely at center
   - Non-interactive (pointer-events-none)

5. **Current Time Display**:
   - Large 2xl font with tabular numbers (compact for landscape)
   - Slate-800 background with rounded corners
   - Centered below the wheels
   - Reduced padding for space efficiency

6. **Modal Dimensions**:
   - Max width: 672px (2xl - wider for landscape)
   - Compact height optimized for 412px viewport
   - All elements scaled down proportionally
   - Maintains visual hierarchy

7. **Action Buttons**:
   - Cancel: Slate gray with hover effect
   - Set Time: Blue gradient with shadow and hover effect
   - Full width, equal spacing

### Scrollbar Styling

Custom thin scrollbars added to `index.css`:

- Width: 6px
- Track: Semi-transparent slate-800
- Thumb: Slate-700 with rounded corners
- Hover: Lighter slate-600
- Smooth transitions

## User Experience

### Interaction Flow

1. User clicks the time picker button
2. Modal opens with current time pre-selected
3. Background scrolling is disabled to focus on time selection
4. Modal is perfectly centered on screen
5. User can:
   - Scroll wheels to browse times
   - Click directly on a time to select it
   - See current selection in large display
6. User clicks "Set Time" to confirm or "Cancel" to dismiss
7. Modal closes with smooth animation and background scrolling is restored

### Time Selection

- **Hours**: 0-23 (24-hour format internally)
- **Minutes**: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55 (5-minute increments)
- **Display**: Converted to 12-hour format with AM/PM for button label
- **Storage**: HH:MM format (e.g., "09:00", "14:30")

## Integration

### Usage in AppSettings

The component is already integrated with the following time pickers:

1. **Quiet Hours** (Start/End Time)
2. **Daily Practice Reminder**

No changes needed to existing code - the `TimePicker` component maintains its API while providing the enhanced UI internally.

## Technical Details

### Modal Positioning & Behavior

- Fixed position covering entire viewport (`inset-0`)
- Very high z-index (`9999`) to ensure it's above all content
- Flexbox centering for perfect alignment
- Padding around modal for small screens
- **Advanced Scroll Lock Implementation**:
  - Saves current scroll position when modal opens
  - Sets body to `position: fixed` with negative top offset
  - Prevents all background scrolling while maintaining visual position
  - Restores exact scroll position when modal closes
  - Prevents modal from being affected by page scroll state

### Scroll Behavior

- `scroll-snap-type: y mandatory`: Ensures items snap to center
- Dynamic scroll calculation based on ITEM_HEIGHT
- Debounced scroll events for smooth updates
- Initial scroll position based on initialTime prop

### State Management

- Internal state for hours and minutes
- Refs for scroll containers (hoursRef, minutesRef)
- isDraggingRef to track scroll state
- Controlled by parent via isOpen prop

### Animations

- Modal: fade-in, zoom-in (200ms duration)
- Buttons: hover transitions (200ms)
- Scrollbars: hover transitions (200ms)
- Text scaling: smooth transitions (200ms)

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with scroll-snap support
- Fallback scrolling without snap on older browsers
- Custom scrollbar styles with webkit prefix
- Standard scrollbar-width for Firefox

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- Add 1-minute increment option
- 12/24 hour format toggle
- Haptic feedback on mobile
- Voice input support
- Keyboard shortcuts (arrow keys, page up/down)
- Preset quick times (morning, afternoon, evening)
- Recent times history

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/settings/TimePickerModal.jsx` (new)
2. `src/components/settings/TimePicker.jsx` (updated)
3. `src/index.css` (added scrollbar styles)

## Testing

Test the time picker in:

1. AppSettings > Notifications & Reminders > Quiet Hours
2. AppSettings > Notifications & Reminders > Daily Practice Reminder
3. Verify:
   - Modal opens/closes smoothly
   - Time selection works by scrolling
   - Time selection works by clicking
   - Set/Cancel buttons function correctly
   - Time displays correctly in 12-hour format
   - Disabled state works properly
