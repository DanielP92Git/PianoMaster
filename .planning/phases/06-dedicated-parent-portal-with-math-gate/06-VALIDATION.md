# Phase 6 — Validation Strategy

> Per-phase validation contract for feedback sampling during execution.

---

## Test Infrastructure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Framework** | vitest |
| **Config file** | `vite.config.js` |
| **Quick run command** | `npx vitest run --reporter=verbose` |
| **Full suite command** | `npm run test:run` |
| **Estimated runtime** | ~30 seconds |

---

## Sampling Rate

- **After every task commit:** Run `npx vitest run --reporter=verbose`
- **After every plan wave:** Run `npm run test:run`
- **Before `/gsd:verify-work`:** Full suite must be green
- **Max feedback latency:** 30 seconds

## Per-Task Verification Map

| Task ID | Plan | Wave | Requirement | Test Type | Automated Command | File Exists | Status |
|---------|------|------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | ⬜ pending |

*Status: ⬜ pending · ✅ green · ❌ red · ⚠️ flaky*

*To be filled after plans are created.*

## Wave 0 Requirements

Existing infrastructure covers all phase requirements.

---

## Manual-Only Verifications

| Behavior | Requirement | Why Manual | Test Instructions |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| Math gate appears on every visit | D-04 | Requires browser interaction | Navigate to /parent-portal, verify gate shows, solve, navigate away, return — gate should re-appear |
| Desktop sidebar shows Parent Zone | D-01 | Visual layout verification | Check sidebar on desktop viewport has ShieldCheck icon entry |
| Mobile Settings has Parent Zone card | D-02 | Visual layout verification | Check Settings page on mobile viewport has prominent entry card |
| Portal sections render after gate | D-07 | Visual integration test | Solve gate, verify all 4 sections visible and scrollable |

---

## Validation Sign-Off

- [ ] All tasks have `<automated>` verify or Wave 0 dependencies
- [ ] Sampling continuity: no 3 consecutive tasks without automated verify
- [ ] Wave 0 covers all MISSING references
- [ ] No watch-mode flags
- [ ] Feedback latency < 30s
- [ ] `nyquist_compliant: true` set in frontmatter

**Approval:** pending
