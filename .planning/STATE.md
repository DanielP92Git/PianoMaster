## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions from v1.0-v1.2 logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**Phase 8 decisions:**
| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| 08-01-01 | Validation runs at prebuild, fails on errors | Catches issues before deploy |
| 08-02-01 | PEDAGOGY.md colocated with trail definitions | Discoverability for developers and agents |

**Phase 9 decisions:**
| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| 09-01-01 | START_ORDER = 51 for bass clef | Places bass after treble units (~50) |
| 09-01-02 | ledgerLines: true for bass C4 | C4 requires ledger line in bass clef |

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Outstanding items (non-blocking):**
- Parental consent verification method needs legal review
- Privacy policy language requires attorney review
- Hard delete Edge Function needed for accounts past 30-day grace period

**v1.3 Risk Areas (from research):**
- Rhythm path pedagogy less established than note reading - may need iteration
- Progress will be reset with v1.3 (documented in PEDAGOGY.md)
- XP economy audit needed before cutover
