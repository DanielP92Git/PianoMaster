# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-31)

**Core value:** Children's data must be protected and inaccessible to unauthorized users
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - COPPA Compliance Implementation

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 3 (COPPA Compliance Implementation)
Plan: Not yet planned
Status: Phase 1 verified, ready to plan Phase 2
Last activity: 2026-01-31 - Phase 1 verified (5/5 must-haves passed)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 33%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 5 minutes
- Total execution time: 15 minutes

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Completed | Total Time | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-----------|------------|----------|
| 01 Critical Security | 3 | 3 | 15 min | 5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Plan 01-01: 4 minutes (database authorization audit)
- Plan 01-02: 8 minutes (client-side authorization)
- Plan 01-03: 4 minutes (secure logout and i18n errors)
- Trend: Consistent, fast execution

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Move migration tracking to database (prevents localStorage manipulation, XP duplication)
- Rate limit at 10 per 5 minutes (prevents XP farming while allowing normal gameplay)
- 30-minute session timeout for students (balances security on shared devices vs. not interrupting practice)
- No separate staging environment (beta phase with few users, adds maintenance burden)
- Audit before implementing (verify what's already done before duplicating work)
- Use is_admin() function for admin checks (not user_metadata which is user-modifiable)
- Defense-in-depth in trigger functions (verify auth.uid() even when RLS should prevent access)
- Preserve accessibility_, i18nextLng, theme, security_update_shown on logout (01-03)
- Clear all sb-* (Supabase) keys on logout to prevent token persistence (01-03)
- Use UUID regex pattern to catch any user ID stored as localStorage key (01-03)
- streakService already secure by design (uses session.user.id internally) (01-02)
- XP operations restricted to self only (user.id === studentId) (01-02)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 2 concerns:**
- Parental consent verification method needs legal review (email+confirmation vs. credit card vs. video call)
- FERPA teacher-as-parent exception may need validation for specific implementation
- Privacy policy language requires attorney review for COPPA compliance
- State age verification laws (TX, UT, LA) may require Play Age Signals API integration

**Phase 3 concerns:**
- Rate limiting thresholds may need tuning based on real-world usage patterns (10 per 5 min baseline)
