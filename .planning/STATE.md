## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Move migration tracking to database (prevents localStorage manipulation, XP duplication)
- Rate limit at 10 per 5 minutes (prevents XP farming while allowing normal gameplay)
- 30-minute session timeout for students (balances security on shared devices vs. not interrupting practice)
- No separate staging environment (beta phase with few users, adds maintenance burden)
- Audit before implementing (verify what's already done before duplicating work)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 2 concerns:**
- Parental consent verification method needs legal review (email+confirmation vs. credit card vs. video call)
- FERPA teacher-as-parent exception may need validation for specific implementation
- Privacy policy language requires attorney review for COPPA compliance
- State age verification laws (TX, UT, LA) may require Play Age Signals API integration

**Phase 3 concerns:**
- Rate limiting thresholds may need tuning based on real-world usage patterns (10 per 5 min baseline)
