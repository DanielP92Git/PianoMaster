## Resolved Items

**DATA-02 (closed 2026-05-12)** — pulse hold path filter validation. Re-triage confirmed no action needed: `PulseQuestion.jsx` uses a hardcoded `PULSE_BEATS` constant (4 quarter notes) and never invokes `resolveByTags`. `MixedLessonGame.buildRhythmTapConfig()` does not emit a `beats` field for `pulse` questions, and `allowRests` / `patternNeedsRests` propagate only through the dictation path. The filter is structurally inapplicable to PulseQuestion.

**35-VALIDATION.md backfill (closed 2026-05-12)** — Nyquist validation strategy authored retroactively for Phase 35. `nyquist_compliant: true`. ARCADE-02 covered by existing `ArcadeRhythmGame.test.js` (12/12 passing) + grep-based source-of-truth checks recorded in 35-VERIFICATION.md; ARCADE-01 is a spike requirement (manual-only by nature, verdict artifact in 35-SPIKE.md).

**phase-33-WIP stash triage (closed 2026-05-12)** — Stash inspected and dropped. Chunks C (tag-based pattern resolution) and E (`boss_rhythm_7` `isBoss` flip) already on main via Phase 33 Plan 06 / BLOCKER-1 close. Chunks B (arcade hold-notes) + D (dynamic tile heights) are substantive unfinished feature work, captured in `.planning/BACKLOG-arcade-hold-notes-WIP.md` for future milestone scoping. Recommended approach when revisited: re-derive from PulseQuestion's shipped hold pattern rather than re-applying the (now-rebase-stale) diff.

**VITE_SUPABASE_URL test env failure (closed 2026-05-12)** — Added stub Supabase env values to `vitest.config.js` (`test.env: { VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY }`). Verified by temporarily removing `.env` and running the previously-failing test files (`NoteSpeedCards.test.js`, `NotesRecognitionGame.autogrow.test.js`, `SightReadingGame.micRestart.test.jsx`) — all 24 tests green. Full suite remains green (1685/1685). Tests should never make real Supabase calls; stubs make tests deterministic regardless of `.env` presence.

## Session Continuity

**Next action:** v3.4 shipped and archived. Options:

- `/gsd-new-milestone` — start next milestone cycle (questioning → research → requirements → roadmap)
- `/gsd-explore` — Socratic ideation if next milestone direction is uncertain
- Address carried backlog items as quick tasks before starting next milestone
