## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions from v1.0-v1.3 logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent decisions affecting v1.4:
- **8 node types for engagement variety**: Provides foundation for node-type-specific celebrations
- **93 nodes final count**: All nodes now available for celebration system
- **Validation at prebuild**: Ensures trail integrity before deployment

### Pending Todos

None. v1.4 just started.

### Blockers/Concerns

**v1.4-specific concerns:**
- Accessibility-first pattern must be established in Phase 13 before any celebration implementation
- Research suggests 400-800ms celebration duration for 8-year-olds, needs validation during implementation
- Service worker cache strategy for celebration components needs clarification (exclude vs. network-first)

**Outstanding items (non-blocking):**
- Orphaned progressMigration.js file (175 lines) — scheduled for removal in Phase 18
- XP display prominence — addressed in Phase 16
