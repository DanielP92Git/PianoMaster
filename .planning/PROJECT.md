# PianoApp

## What This Is

A piano learning PWA for 8-year-old learners with gamification, skill progression trails, and multi-game modes. Security hardened with COPPA compliance, protecting children's data through layered authorization, parental consent flows, and shared device safeguards.

## Core Value

**Children's data must be protected and inaccessible to unauthorized users.** Every feature prioritizes preventing unauthorized access to child data, ensuring safe logout on shared devices, and preventing abuse of the XP/progression system.

## Requirements

### Validated

These capabilities exist, are working, and have been shipped:

**v1.0 Security Hardening (shipped 2026-02-01):**
- SEC-01: RLS policies use database state (not user_metadata) for authorization
- SEC-02: All SECURITY DEFINER functions have auth.uid() checks
- SEC-03: Client-side services verify user.id matches studentId
- SEC-04: Logout clears all user-specific localStorage keys
- SESS-01: Students auto-logout after 30min inactivity
- SESS-02: Teachers auto-logout after 2hr inactivity
- SESS-03: Inactivity timer resets on user interaction
- RATE-01: Score submissions limited to 10 per 5min per node
- RATE-02: Rate limiting enforced at database level
- RATE-03: Rate limit violations return clear error message
- COPPA-01: Data export returns all student data as JSON
- COPPA-02: Data deletion removes all student data with 30-day grace
- COPPA-03: Student usernames anonymized in shared features
- COPPA-04: Neutral age gate collects DOB (not checkbox)
- COPPA-05: Parental consent blocks data collection until verified
- COPPA-06: No third-party data collection (self-hosted fonts)

**Pre-existing:**
- Supabase authentication (email/password)
- Student/teacher role differentiation
- Trail gamification system with XP and levels
- Daily goals generation and tracking
- Multiple game modes (sight reading, notes recognition, rhythm)

### Active

Requirements for next milestone (to be defined):

- [ ] Hard delete Edge Function for accounts past 30-day grace period
- [ ] Production deployment to Google Play / Apple App Store
- [ ] Beta testing with human verification checklist

### Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded:

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Performance optimizations | Not security-critical, separate project |
| Memory Game trail integration bug | Functional bug, not security |
| Debug code cleanup | Code quality, not security |
| Test coverage expansion | Important but not blocking security work |
| VexFlow rendering optimization | Performance, not security |
| Sound file bundle reduction | Performance, not security |

## Context

**Current State (after v1.0):**
- App hardened with 3-layer authorization (RLS, SECURITY DEFINER, client-side)
- COPPA compliant for children under 13
- Ready for security-focused beta testing
- 177 files modified, 31,659 lines added in v1 milestone

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: React 18, Vite 6, React Router v7
- State: Redux Toolkit (minimal), React Context (feature-scoped), TanStack Query v5
- Backend: Supabase (auth, database, real-time)
- Music: VexFlow v5 for notation, Klavier for keyboard input
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom design system

**User Demographics:**
- Primary users: 8-year-old children learning piano
- Secondary users: Teachers managing students, parents overseeing progress
- COPPA compliance required for children under 13

**Known Issues (non-blocking):**
- Parental consent verification method needs legal review
- Privacy policy language requires attorney review
- State age verification laws may require Play Age Signals API

## Constraints

- **Backend**: Supabase (auth, database, real-time) — no changes to this choice
- **Compatibility**: Must not break existing beta user data or progress
- **Compliance**: Must meet Google Play and Apple App Store security requirements
- **COPPA**: Must comply with children's data protection regulations (under 13)
- **COPPA Deadline**: April 22, 2026 for full compliance

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| is_admin() function for admin checks | user_metadata is user-modifiable via supabase.auth.updateUser() | Good |
| Defense-in-depth in triggers | Verify auth.uid() even when RLS should prevent access | Good |
| Trigger-based is_under_13 column | GENERATED ALWAYS AS doesn't support date functions | Good |
| Neutral DOB collection | COPPA requires dropdown menus not leading questions | Good |
| Fixed window rate limiting | Simpler than sliding window, reset after 5 min of inactivity | Good |
| 30min student / 2hr teacher timeout | Balance security on shared devices vs. not interrupting practice | Good |
| crossTab with leaderElection | One tab coordinates timeout across all tabs | Good |
| Fontsource packages for fonts | npm versioning, Vite bundling, no manual font management | Good |
| No separate staging environment | Beta phase with few users; adds maintenance burden | Good |
