# Milestone v1.2 Audit Report

**Milestone:** v1.2 Trail System Stabilization
**Audited:** 2026-02-03
**Status:** passed

## Executive Summary

All 15 requirements satisfied. All 2 phases passed verification. Cross-phase integration complete with 13/13 connections verified. 5/5 E2E flows work end-to-end. Minor tech debt identified but not blocking.

## Requirements Coverage

### Trail Foundation (4/4)

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| TRAIL-01: Commit trail redesign Phase 1 files | SATISFIED | constants.js, nodeTypes.js, sections.js, units 1-3 committed |
| TRAIL-02: Commit trail redesign Phase 2 files | SATISFIED | MemoryGame integration, navigation updates committed |
| TRAIL-03: All 26 treble clef nodes load without errors | SATISFIED | 7+boss in Unit1, 7+boss in Unit2, 9+boss in Unit3 |
| TRAIL-04: No eighth notes in Units 1-3 | SATISFIED | Verified in unit definitions |

### Memory Game Integration (5/5)

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| MEM-01: Memory game auto-starts from trail | SATISFIED | MemoryGame.jsx:294-322 useEffect |
| MEM-02: Uses correct note pool from config | SATISFIED | nodeConfig.notePool passed and applied |
| MEM-03: Grid size parsed correctly | SATISFIED | "2x4", "3x4" parsing works |
| MEM-04: VictoryScreen shows correct stars/XP | SATISFIED | Score calculation: (cards.length / 2) * 10 |
| MEM-05: Progress saved to database | SATISFIED | skillProgressService.updateExerciseProgress() |

### Navigation (4/4)

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| NAV-01: Start Practice navigates correctly | SATISFIED | TrailNodeModal.jsx:113-114 |
| NAV-02: Next Exercise button appears | SATISFIED | VictoryScreen.jsx:728-734 |
| NAV-03: Cross-exercise-type navigation works | SATISFIED | All 4 game types handle handleNextExercise |
| NAV-04: Back to Trail returns correctly | SATISFIED | VictoryScreen.jsx:765-768 |

### Cleanup (2/2)

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| CLEAN-01: Remove temp docs from root | SATISFIED | IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md, PHASE2_COMPLETE.md, etc. removed |
| CLEAN-02: Remove debug files | SATISFIED | verify-redesign.mjs, unlock-nodes-test.sql removed |

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Status | Score | Human Verification |
|-------|--------|-------|-------------------|
| 06-trail-stabilization | passed | 6/6 truths | 3 items (Memory Game visual, progress persistence, multi-exercise) |
| 07-tech-debt-cleanup | passed | 4/4 truths | None required |

## Integration Verification

### Export/Import Wiring (13/13)

| Export | From | Used By | Status |
|--------|------|---------|--------|
| EXERCISE_TYPES.MEMORY_GAME | constants.js | MemoryGame, VictoryScreen, units | CONNECTED |
| getNodeById | skillTrail.js | TrailNodeModal, VictoryScreen, MemoryGame | CONNECTED |
| updateExerciseProgress | skillProgressService.js | VictoryScreen | CONNECTED |
| getExerciseProgress | skillProgressService.js | TrailNodeModal | CONNECTED |
| getNextExerciseIndex | skillProgressService.js | TrailNodeModal | CONNECTED |
| verifyStudentDataAccess | authorizationUtils.js | apiScores, skillProgressService | CONNECTED |
| memory_game i18n (en) | trail.json | TrailNodeModal | CONNECTED |
| memory_game i18n (he) | trail.json | TrailNodeModal | CONNECTED |
| handleNextExercise | NotesRecognitionGame | VictoryScreen callback | CONNECTED |
| handleNextExercise | SightReadingGame | VictoryScreen callback | CONNECTED |
| handleNextExercise | MetronomeTrainer | VictoryScreen callback | CONNECTED |
| handleNextExercise | MemoryGame | VictoryScreen callback | CONNECTED |
| nodeConfig state | TrailNodeModal | All game components | CONNECTED |

### E2E Flows (5/5)

| Flow | Status |
|------|--------|
| Trail → Memory Game → Stars visible | COMPLETE |
| Boss node multi-exercise → minimum stars | COMPLETE |
| Page refresh → progress persists | COMPLETE |
| Next Exercise navigation | COMPLETE |
| Back to Trail after completion | COMPLETE |

## Tech Debt

### Non-Blocking Items (1)

**Phase 07:**
- `apiDatabase.js` still has local `verifyStudentDataAccess` function (lines 14-39). Not in scope for DEBT-03 which targeted only `apiScores.js`. Consider deduplication in future pass.

## Human Verification Required

From Phase 06 verification:

1. **Memory Game Visual Test**
   - Navigate to treble_1_4 node
   - Verify 2x4 grid with C4/D4 notes
   - Why: Requires visual confirmation of rendering

2. **Progress Persistence Test**
   - Complete Memory Game
   - Refresh page
   - Verify stars visible on node
   - Why: Requires actual gameplay

3. **Multi-Exercise Test**
   - Complete boss node with multiple exercises
   - Verify navigation between exercises
   - Verify node stars = minimum across all exercises
   - Why: Requires completing exercise sequence

## Conclusion

Milestone v1.2 **PASSED** audit. All requirements covered, all phases verified, cross-phase integration complete. Ready for completion and archival.
