# Remove Sight Reading Challenge Mode - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Removed the "Sight Reading Challenge" game mode from the application as it has no games implemented yet.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration

**File**: `supabase/migrations/20250121000001_remove_sight_reading_mode.sql`

**SQL**:

```sql
DELETE FROM games_categories
WHERE type = 'sight-reading-mode'
   OR type = 'sight-reading'
   OR name LIKE '%Sight Reading%';
```

This removes the Sight Reading mode from the database `games_categories` table.

### 2. Code Changes

#### File: `src/components/ui/Toast.jsx`

**Removed the sight-reading emoji mapping**

Before:

```jsx
const gameEmoji =
  gameType === "note-recognition"
    ? "üéµ"
    : gameType === "rhythm-master"
      ? "ü•Å"
      : gameType === "sight-reading"
        ? "üìñ"
        : "üéÆ";
```

After:

```jsx
const gameEmoji =
  gameType === "note-recognition"
    ? "üéµ"
    : gameType === "rhythm-master"
      ? "ü•Å"
      : "üéÆ";
```

#### File: `src/components/teacher/AssignmentManagement.jsx`

**Removed the sight-reading option from practice mode dropdown**

Before:

```jsx
<option value="note-recognition">Note Recognition</option>
<option value="rhythm-master">Rhythm Master</option>
<option value="sight-reading">Sight Reading</option>
```

After:

```jsx
<option value="note-recognition">Note Recognition</option>
<option value="rhythm-master">Rhythm Master</option>
```

## Impact

### User Interface

- **Practice Modes page** will now show only 2 cards:
  1. Rhythm Master
  2. Notes Reading (formerly Note Recognition)
- The "Sight Reading Challenge" card will no longer appear

### Teacher Dashboard

- Teachers can no longer assign "Sight Reading" as a practice mode
- Existing assignments with sight-reading mode will need to be handled (check if any exist)

### Toast Notifications

- Removed the üìñ emoji for sight-reading game type
- Falls back to generic üéÆ emoji if an unknown game type is encountered

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Removed sight-reading references from Toast.jsx
- [x] Removed sight-reading option from AssignmentManagement.jsx
- [x] Created database migration to delete sight-reading mode
- [x] No linter errors
- [ ] Database migration applied (manual step required)
- [ ] Practice Modes page shows only 2 cards
- [ ] Teacher assignment form shows only 2 practice mode options

## Manual Steps Required

To complete the removal, apply the database migration:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Run the DELETE statement from the migration file
3. Verify with: `SELECT * FROM games_categories;`
4. Refresh the application

See `APPLY_MIGRATION_MANUALLY.md` for detailed instructions (includes both the rename and remove migrations).

## Future Considerations

### If Sight Reading Mode is Needed Later

If you want to add it back in the future:

1. **Create the mode route and components**
2. **Add back to database**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO games_categories (type, name, description, icon)
   VALUES (
     'sight-reading-mode',
     'Sight Reading Challenge',
     'Practice reading and playing sheet music in real-time',
     'üìñ'
   );
   ```
3. **Restore code references**:
   - Add back to Toast.jsx emoji mapping
   - Add back to AssignmentManagement.jsx dropdown
   - Create game components in `src/components/games/sight-reading-games/`

### Checking for Historical Data

Before the final deletion, you may want to check if any users have data related to sight-reading:

```sql
-- Check for practice sessions
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM practice_sessions
WHERE game_type = 'sight-reading' OR game_type LIKE '%sight-reading%';

-- Check for assignments
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM assignments
WHERE practice_mode = 'sight-reading';

-- Check for user progress
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_game_progress
WHERE game_mode = 'sight-reading-mode';
```

If any data exists, you may want to:

- Migrate it to another game type
- Keep the category but mark it as "archived" or "disabled"
- Notify affected users

## Result

‚úÖ Sight Reading Challenge mode has been removed from:

- Database (pending migration)
- UI components
- Teacher assignment options
- Toast notifications

The application now focuses on the two active game modes with implemented games:

1. **Rhythm Master** - Metronome Trainer, Your Groove
2. **Notes Reading** - Memory Game, Notes Reading Game
