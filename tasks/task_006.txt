### Details:
Include student names, attendance, and overall class statistics. Integrate real-time updates for roster changes and class metrics.
<info added on 2025-06-25T16:36:05.839Z>
The Teacher Dashboard now features a comprehensive class overview component with real-time data integration. The implementation includes a complete API service layer (src/services/apiTeacher.js) handling teacher profiles, class management with auto-generated codes, student enrollment, dashboard data aggregation, search capabilities, and class statistics calculation.

The TeacherDashboard component (src/components/layout/TeacherDashboard.jsx) provides summary statistics (students, classes, streaks, accuracy), searchable student management, class overviews with codes, a live activity feed, and responsive design for all devices.

Key technical achievements include intelligent data fetching with optimized queries, controlled real-time polling, comprehensive search and filtering, empty state handling for new teachers, robust error boundaries, and detailed per-student performance metrics.

The dashboard analytics system offers aggregated class statistics with trend analysis, multi-metric student progress tracking, real-time activity monitoring, and visual performance indicators. The component successfully integrates with our authentication system, real-time subscription architecture, React Query for data management, and the existing UI component library.

## Scope Refinement - Focus on Core Teacher-Student Features

Based on user feedback, we're refocusing the Teacher Dashboard implementation to prioritize direct teacher-student relationships rather than complex class management. This aligns better with immediate user needs and simplifies our initial release.

Key modifications to the implementation:
- Simplify the dashboard UI to focus on individual student connections rather than class-based organization
- Modify the database queries in apiTeacher.js to support direct teacher-student relationships without requiring class creation
- Implement direct student addition via email/ID lookup rather than class codes
- Display individual student practice data and progress metrics in a streamlined view
- Add basic messaging functionality between teachers and students
- Ensure the dashboard prominently displays student activity feeds and practice session history

The TeacherDashboard component will be refactored to emphasize:
1. A simplified student connection interface
2. Individual student progress tracking
3. Basic communication tools
4. Direct visibility into student practice sessions

This approach reduces initial complexity while delivering the core value proposition for teachers.
