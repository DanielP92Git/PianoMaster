## 2. Implement Note Rendering System [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop a system to render musical notes using SVG or Canvas.
### Details:
Ensure compatibility with treble and bass clef.
<info added on 2025-06-24T19:52:04.600Z>
The note rendering system is fully implemented with high-quality SVG files. Assets include complete sets for both treble clef notes (treble-do-middle.svg through treble-do-second.svg) and bass clef notes (bass-do-middle.svg through bass-si-small.svg), along with clef symbols. These professional-quality SVGs from MuseScore Studio 4.4.4 feature proper musical notation with accurate positioning, complete staff lines, bar lines, and note heads in scalable vector format. The game currently renders these images in 192x192px white rounded containers with proper scaling and accessibility features. No additional development is needed for the note rendering system as it already comprehensively supports both treble and bass clefs.

## 3. Add Treble and Bass Clef Support [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Integrate treble and bass clef rendering into the note system.
### Details:
Ensure proper note placement and display.
<info added on 2025-06-24T19:53:06.513Z>
Implement support for both treble and bass clefs in the note rendering system. The system should:
- Allow dynamic switching between treble and bass clefs via the GameSettings component
- Maintain separate note arrays for each clef type with appropriate SVG images
- Render notes conditionally based on the selected clef (trebleNotes or bassNotes)
- Ensure proper staff line positioning and accurate note placement for each clef
- Include Hebrew note naming (דו/Do to סי/Si) mapped correctly to both clef systems
- Implement error handling with clef-specific fallback images
- Maintain consistent visual styling across both clef types
</info added on 2025-06-24T19:53:06.513Z>

## 4. Develop Note Generation Algorithm [done]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Create an algorithm to generate notes with configurable difficulty levels.
### Details:
Use randomization and difficulty scaling.
<info added on 2025-06-24T19:54:10.247Z>
The note generation algorithm uses randomization through Math.floor(Math.random()) to select notes from appropriate arrays based on clef setting (treble or bass). Difficulty scaling is implemented through time limits: Easy (60 seconds), Medium (45 seconds, default), and Hard (30 seconds). The system includes two game modes: Timed Mode with 10 fixed questions and Practice Mode with unlimited questions. User customization allows selection of clef type and specific notes for practice (minimum 2 notes required). The algorithm validates selections, includes fallbacks for invalid configurations, and ensures equal probability distribution across all selected notes. Settings persist throughout the game session, with no predictable patterns in the randomization.

## 5. Implement User Input Mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Create an input system for users to identify notes (keyboard, on-screen piano, or buttons).
### Details:
Ensure intuitive and responsive input handling.
<info added on 2025-06-24T19:54:36.610Z>
The user input mechanism is fully implemented with a button-based note selection system. The interface features a 2x3 grid of note buttons displaying Hebrew note names (דו, רה, מי, פה, סול, לה, סי) that dynamically update based on the selected clef. The system provides immediate audio and visual feedback upon selection, with automatic progression to the next note. Input validation ensures proper comparison between selected and correct answers while handling edge cases gracefully. The design prioritizes accessibility with clear visual contrast, proper hover states, logical tab order, and correct Hebrew text directionality. The responsive layout scales appropriately across different devices with adequate spacing for touch interfaces. The input mechanism integrates seamlessly with the scoring system, sound feedback, and note generation components.

## 6. Develop Scoring and Feedback System [done]
### Dependencies: 8.5
### Description: Implement a scoring system based on accuracy and speed, with feedback animations.
### Details:
Use animations to provide immediate feedback on correct/incorrect answers.
<info added on 2025-06-24T19:55:28.002Z>
