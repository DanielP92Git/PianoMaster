# Task ID: 10
# Title: Develop Sight-Reading Practice Mode
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the Sight-Reading practice mode with progressive exercises, difficulty scaling, and performance tracking.
# Details:
1. Design sight-reading interface with scrolling notation
2. Implement music notation rendering system
3. Create exercise generation algorithm with progressive difficulty
4. Develop input mechanism for note entry (keyboard, on-screen piano)
5. Implement real-time feedback on accuracy
6. Add tempo control and metronome integration
7. Create scoring system based on accuracy and completeness
8. Implement difficulty adjustment based on performance
9. Add session summary with detailed metrics
10. Integrate with recording system for session capture

# Test Strategy:
Test sight-reading exercises across different difficulty levels. Verify that notation rendering is accurate and responsive. Test input mechanisms for responsiveness and accuracy. Ensure that scoring and feedback help users improve their sight-reading skills.
