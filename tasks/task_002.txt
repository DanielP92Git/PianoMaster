# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Supabase Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Supabase project, configure authentication, database tables, storage buckets, and real-time subscriptions according to the data models in the PRD.
# Details:
1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Install Supabase client: `npm install @supabase/supabase-js`
3. Configure authentication with email/password provider
4. Create database tables according to the PRD schema:
   - Users table
   - Sessions table
   - Games table
   - Messages table
   - Teacher_Students table
5. Set up row-level security policies for each table
6. Create storage buckets for audio recordings with appropriate permissions
7. Configure real-time subscriptions for relevant tables
8. Create API service layer for Supabase interactions
9. Implement helper functions for common database operations

# Test Strategy:
Test authentication flow, database CRUD operations, storage uploads/downloads, and real-time subscription functionality. Verify that row-level security policies are working correctly by testing access with different user roles.
