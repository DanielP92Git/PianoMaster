# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Audio Recording and Playback
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop audio recording capability with Web Audio API and integrate with Supabase Storage for saving and retrieving practice session recordings.
# Details:
1. Create AudioRecorder component using Web Audio API
2. Implement recording controls (start, stop, pause)
3. Add audio visualization during recording
4. Develop audio compression before upload
5. Integrate with Supabase Storage for file uploads
6. Create audio playback component with controls
7. Implement progress bar and time display for playback
8. Add error handling for browser compatibility issues
9. Create fallback options for unsupported browsers
10. Implement caching for frequently accessed recordings

# Test Strategy:
Test recording and playback across all supported browsers. Verify that audio files are correctly uploaded to Supabase Storage and can be retrieved. Test with various audio lengths and quality settings. Ensure error handling works correctly when permissions are denied or browser is incompatible.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Audio Recording Component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create an AudioRecorder component using the Web Audio API and MediaStream Recording API to capture microphone input and manage recording states (start, stop, pause).
### Details:
Implement microphone access using getUserMedia, handle recording controls, and ensure compatibility with major browsers.

Initial analysis of audio recording infrastructure complete. Found existing implementation in `PracticeRecorder` component (src/components/practice/PracticeRecorder.jsx) with full Web Audio API functionality. Current implementation includes:

- Functional recording with MediaRecorder API (44100 sample rate, 128000 audioBitsPerSecond)
- Error handling for browser compatibility
- Microphone access management with proper cleanup
- Integration with Supabase Storage
- Start/stop/cancel recording controls
- Real-time recording state management

Gap analysis shows basic recording and storage integration are complete, but audio visualization, advanced compression, unified playback, and component reusability are missing.

Next steps:
1. Extract core recording logic into reusable `AudioRecorder` component
2. Implement audio visualization using AnalyserNode (priority for next subtask)
3. Enhance audio compression options
4. Create unified recording/playback interface
5. Add advanced recording controls (pause/resume)

<info added on 2025-06-25T15:30:22.000Z>
Implementation of audio recording functionality is now complete with the creation of reusable components:

1. **AudioRecorder.jsx** (`src/components/ui/AudioRecorder.jsx`)
   - Reusable recording component with Web Audio API
   - Real-time audio visualization using AnalyserNode and Canvas
   - Advanced recording controls: start/stop/pause/resume
   - Comprehensive error handling for browser compatibility
   - Duration tracking with progress bar and auto-stop at max duration
   - Proper cleanup and resource management
   - Visual status indicators (recording, paused, completed)

2. **AudioPlayer.jsx** (`src/components/ui/AudioPlayer.jsx`)
   - Full-featured audio playback component
   - Seek bar with click-to-seek and drag functionality
   - Volume control with mute toggle
   - Skip forward/backward (10s intervals)
   - Time display and progress tracking
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Auto-play and loop options

3. **PracticeRecorder.jsx** has been refactored to use the new AudioRecorder component, with enhanced UI for audio preview and better separation of concerns.

All key features have been implemented including Web Audio API integration, real-time frequency visualization, pause/resume functionality, error handling, progress tracking, and proper resource cleanup. Components are built and integrated, ready for cross-browser testing.

Moving to next subtask: Implement Audio Visualization (though basic visualization is already included in the AudioRecorder component).

## 2. Implement Audio Visualization [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Add real-time audio visualization during recording using the Web Audio API's AnalyserNode.
### Details:
Display waveform or frequency data while recording to provide user feedback.

## 3. Integrate Audio Compression and Upload [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Compress recorded audio before uploading and integrate with Supabase Storage for saving recordings.
### Details:

# Audio Compression and Upload Analysis

## Current State Analysis
1. **AudioRecorder.jsx** already implements basic compression:
   - Uses MediaRecorder with "audio/webm;codecs=opus" (optimal compression)
   - Fallback to "audio/webm" for browser compatibility  
   - Audio bit rate set to 128kbps for good quality/size balance
   - Single-channel recording (channelCount: 1) for smaller files

2. **practiceService.js** handles Supabase Storage integration:
   - Uploads .webm files with proper content type
   - Uses consistent filename format with timestamps
   - Implements signed URL generation for secure access
   - Has error handling and cleanup functionality

## Gaps Identified
1. No additional format options (MP3, OGG) for broader compatibility
2. No client-side audio quality options
3. No file size optimization before upload
4. No progress tracking during upload
5. No retry logic for failed uploads

## Implementation Plan
1. Create enhanced AudioCompressionService for multiple format support
2. Add upload progress tracking to practiceService
3. Implement retry logic and better error handling
4. Add client-side audio quality selection options
5. Optimize file sizes for different use cases
