# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project with Vite + React, configure Tailwind CSS, and set up CI/CD with Vercel deployment.
# Details:
1. Create a new Vite project with React template: `npm create vite@latest piano-practice-app --template react-ts`
2. Install and configure Tailwind CSS: `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer` and initialize config
3. Set up React-Query for state management: `npm install @tanstack/react-query`
4. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality
5. Create basic folder structure (components, hooks, pages, utils, services, types)
6. Initialize Git repository and create initial commit
7. Connect to Vercel for CI/CD deployment
8. Set up environment variables for development and production
9. Configure Sentry for error tracking: `npm install @sentry/react`

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the development server runs without errors, build process completes successfully, and deployment pipeline works correctly. Test that Tailwind CSS styles are applied properly and React-Query is functioning as expected.
